# kibana-docker

The Shell Commands And Node Scripts Used To Create The `artdeco/kibana` Image In A Dockerfile.

%TOC%

## Clean-up Of Dependnecies

The problem with the official _Kibana_ image is that it contains all `node_modules`, even the dev dependencies. In addition, the Webpack is so integrated into _Kibana_ that it is required in the production version also, however it does not do anything because the front-end bundles have been pre-compiled. This project removes all unnecessary Babel, React, Webpack & co evil from the distributed image by finding out what dependencies are really needed and thus producing the most minimal built that is not shameful to run in a container.

The image also adds an authorisation level by running an http proxy server to access _Kibana_.

## Dockerfile

We use the *Multi-Stage Build* to create an optimized version of the image.

%EXAMPLE-docker: Dockerfile%

## Development Version & Preparing

The dev environment for reproduction locally can be set-up by downloading the [snapshot Kibana](https://snapshots.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-oss-6.6.0-SNAPSHOT-linux-x86_64.tar.gz) and extracting it to the `kibana` directory. This will emulate Docker downloading it for us. Next, there are the following preparation steps.

### Link Internal Packages

There are internal packages that need to be linked. Copy them internal packages in the same way as the `Dockerfile` does, that is create `kibana/packages` and run

```sh
cp -R kibana/node_modules/\@kbn/config-schema kibana/packages/kbn-config-schema
cp -R kibana/node_modules/\@kbn/i18n kibana/packages/kbn-i18n
cp -R kibana/node_modules/\@kbn/interpreter kibana/packages/interpreter
# Add linked the packages from the kibana dir
cd kibana;
yarn add link:packages/kbn-config-schema link:packages/kbn-i18n link:packages/kbn-interpreter/
```

### Built `Interpreter` Package

The `interpreter` package needs to be rebuilt without `babel-runtime` for which we can use Ã€LaMode.

```sh
yarn alamode kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/src/common/lib -o kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/target/common/lib -s
yarn alamode kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/src/common/interpreter/interpret.js -o kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/target/common/interpreter -s
yarn alamode kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/src/server/get_plugin_paths.js -o kibana/packages/kbn-interpreter/target/server -s
```

Because the plugin's frontend is pre-built separately, it should not affect the workings of _Kibana_. The method to figure out which files need to be built is to try run the `install-deps` and see where it failed.

### Add Patched `kbn_server`

Then, the `kibana/src/server/kbn_server.js` needs to be updated with the patched version that removes the _Optimize_ plugin from `build/server/kbn_server.js`.

### Update Vendor's Public Path

9 vendor files from `kibana/optimize` need `__REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_PATH__` replaced to an empty string.

### Entry point

Our `build/cli.js` is a substitute to `kibana/src/cli/index.js` that skips babel setup. It will start the _Kibana_ server and the proxy server and it is the entry point of the application invoked with `yarn start`.

## Taken From Source

- [x] To find out the exact required dependencies' versions, the [kibana/v6.6.0/package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/kibana/v6.6.0/package.json) file is taken from GitHub and put in the `install_deps` as `kibana.json` for the use by `install-deps.js`.
- [x] The `src/server/kbn_server.js` is updated to remove the Optimize mixin.

## The `install-deps` Tool

The tool is used to find all missing dependencies by attempting to start the server, and failing, and extracting the missing module name and the file location where the error happened to display in CLI.

<!--
## `verify-versions`

This tool will fetch the `package.json` from GitHub, and compare the versions in the Kibana's `package.json` against the online values. The verification step can be required to make sure that there are no rogue dependencies in this image. -->
