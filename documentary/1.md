## Clean-up Of Dependencies

The problem with the official _Kibana_ image is that it contains all `node_modules`, even the dev dependencies. In addition, the Webpack is so integrated into _Kibana_ that it is required in the production version also, however it does not do anything because the front-end bundles have been pre-compiled. This project removes all unnecessary Babel, React, Webpack from the distributed image by finding out what dependencies are really needed and thus producing the most minimal built that can be run in a container.

The image also adds an authorisation level by running an http proxy server to access _Kibana_.
