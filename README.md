# kibana-docker
The Shell Commands And Node Scripts Used To Create The Artdeco/Kibana Image In A Dockerfile.

## Dockerfile

We use the *Multi-Stage Build* to create an optimized version of the image.

```docker
##Â Stage 0: Prepare Kibana
FROM node:alpine as builder

# 1. Download 6.5.2-snapshot and strip node and node_modules
RUN wget -qO- https://snapshots.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-oss-6.5.2-SNAPSHOT-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz

RUN mv kibana-6.5.2-SNAPSHOT-linux-x86_64 kibana
WORKDIR /kibana
RUN mkdir packages
# Keep the required modules built from  the monorepo
RUN cp -R node_modules/\@kbn/config-schema/ packages/kbn-config-schema
RUN cp -R node_modules/\@kbn/datemath/ packages/kbn-datemath
RUN cp -R node_modules/\@kbn/i18n/ packages/kbn-i18n
# Runnable code is in target therefore src is unrequired
RUN rm -rf packages/kbn-config-schema/src packages/kbn-datemath/src packages/kbn-i18n/src
RUN rm -rf node node_modules

# 2. Add the package.json and yarn.lock files that we've generated.
ADD contrib/package.json package.json
ADD contrib/yarn.lock yarn.lock

# 3. Download and install node_modules.
RUN yarn

# 4. Patch the source code:
# remove Optimize mixin and __REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_PATH__
ADD build/server/kbn_server.js src/server/kbn_server.js
RUN find optimize -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/__REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_PATH__//g' {} \;

# STAGE 2: Setup Proxy
FROM node:alpine
COPY --from=builder kibana kibana

ADD package.json .
ADD yarn.lock .
RUN yarn

# Add The Login Screen
ADD static static

ADD build build/cli.js
ADD build build/proxy-server.js

ENV NODE_ENV production

# Same entrypoint as prev version.
ENTRYPOINT node build/cli -e http://$ELASTIC_SEARCH:9200
```

## Development Version

The dev environment can be set-up by downloading the [snapshot Kibana](https://snapshots.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-oss-6.5.2-SNAPSHOT-linux-x86_64.tar.gz) and extracting it to the `kibana` directory. This will emulater Docker downloading it for us. Then, the `kibana/src/server/kbn_server.js` need to be updated, along with 3 files from `kibana/optimize` which need `__REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_PATH__` replaced to an empty string. The server and the proxy server can then be started with `build/cli`.

## Taken From Source

- [x] To find out the exact required dependencies' versions, the [kibana/v6.5.2/package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/kibana/v6.5.2/package.json) file is taken from GitHub.
- [x] The `src/server/kbn_server.js` and `src/cli/index.js` are updated to remove Optimize mixing and the `setup-node-env` require.

### Tools

## `install-deps`

The tool is used to find all missing dependencies by attempting to start the server, and failing, and extracting the missing module name and the file location where the error happened to display in CLI.

## `verify-versions`

This tool will fetch the `package.json` from GitHub, and compare the versions in the Kibana's `package.json` against the online values. The verification step can be required to make sure that there are no rogue dependencies in this image.
